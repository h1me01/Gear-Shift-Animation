# Gear Shifting Animation Script

A script for adding immersive gear-shifting animations and sounds for cars and motorcycles, inspired by Hunk's old mod which is no longer functional.

Some might recognize it from [here](https://www.gta5-mods.com/scripts/gear-shifting-animation), where I originally posted it.
